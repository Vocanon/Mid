      He along with a mysterious being know as Drakian, built the ancient forge, and created the weapons that all four guardians would use.
      Sadly the leader died in battle but before he died he predicted that one day his descendant would become a legendary being.
      There was great evil that would someday arise and threated all of not just the galaxy of unity but the entire universe.
      Over time the Netherians grew from a small race into a kingdom that turned in the Great Netherian empire, than into an empire that controlled the entire planet of 
      Volcania. Eventually they made it to space and started colonizing other planets in the local arm of the galaxy.
      God was the center of the entire life of most of Volcania, and was the source of the power that the guardians would wield
